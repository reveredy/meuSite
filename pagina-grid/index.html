                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly fell I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my life. Since completing the course,I've
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've
                never written a line of code. I needed
                some structure from professionals
                who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to
                enroll by a former student of theirs
                who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                curriculum and staff did not
                disappoint. They were very hands-on
                and I never had to wait long for
                assistence. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took
                my learning to the next level in a way
                that no tutorial could ever have. In
                fact, I've often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my
                development experience. It certainly
                helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple
                offers. 100% recommend!"

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
                their experiences was easy.

                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out int the world and present
                myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
